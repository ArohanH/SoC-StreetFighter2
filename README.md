# SoC-StreetFighter2
This is the repo containing my final project for SoC 2023 by WnCC, IIT Bombay
* My final project was to train an RL agent to play the Street Fighter 2 game.
* I have chosen to use Deep Q Learning Algorithm for training my agent with the help of tensorflow to build the neural network.
* Guidelines for running the project:
  1)Currently the code uploaded in github is for testing the model and the model has been trained for two different values of learning rates for several number of         epsiodes
